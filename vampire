	<h2>A website dedicated to revealing the TRUTH</h2>

	<img src="vampire.jpg" alt="Rare photo caught of a vampire />

	<p>Many people ask me why I have dedicated my entire life's work to the mystery of the vampire. They say: "there are so many more pressing issues!", "you have no hard evidence!", "vampires are the least of our worries against the existential threats of nuclear war, global warming, and artificial intelligence", but I know better my friends.
This guide has been divided into lessons. You should read them chronologically; however, in emergencies, I understand one particular lesson can mean the difference between life and death for amateurs</p>

	<h3 id="lesson_1">Lesson 1: The Prevalence of Vampires in our population</h3>

	<p>Lesson number one: <em>vampires are everywhere</em>. They have infiltrated the ranks of the police force, politicians, any body of power. Even actuaries, the mathematical wizards in charge of insurance predictions have a plethora of vampires in their league, insidiously inflating predictions of death to help disguise the high incidences of slaughters done by vampires. The human race can never advance under the tyranny of the parasitic vampires.</p>
	<p>Because vampires are immortal and have existed since the dawn of man, they make up a non-significant number of our population. Due to the good work of vampire slayers and the laborous process of creating a new vampire, their population has dwindled steadily. We estimate there exists around 500,000 vampires mingling in the general population. <em>Make no mistake</em>, vampires remain our most dangerous predator as their increased capabilities render them able to slay hundreds, if not thousands, of humans.</p>

	<h3 id="lesson_2">Lesson 2: Vampires in Your Life</h3>

	<p>Lesson number two: if a vampire realizes you know they are a vampire <strong> they will not hesitate to kill you</strong>. This is the real danger of my profession and why I remain anonymous on my website and in the public media. If vampire leadership caught wind of my real identity (and they have gotten close in the past), they would kill me immediately.</p>
	<p>As a result of being alive for hundreds of years, many vampires have learned to subvert their evil nature and disguise themselves as charming, upper class professionals. Their years of existence allow them to become experts in their fields and thus gain the respect and following of academia. Additionally, many vampires because of their plethora of connections have served in presidential cabinets and political regimes.</p>
	<p>However, with the onset of visual social media, many vampires have been forced to leave the limelight in fear of their immortality being discovered and are more inclined towards moving from place to place around every 10 - 20 years. Since there are around 500,000 vampires, this means at some point, you are likely to have a vampire in your aquaintence. In addition to their power of charm, vampires have the ability to hypnotize their prey.</p>
	<p>Do you understand the sheer danger we are in here? Good, now we can move on to practical self defense.</p>

	<hr />

	<h3 id="lesson_3">Lesson 3: Self Defense</h3>

	<p>There are a number of items vampires can not bear to touch, which you can use to sucessfully identify a vampire in your life including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>garlic</li>
		<li>toilet paper</li>
		<li>paisley-patterned cloth</li>
		<li>hamsters</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Once you have properly identified a vampire, do not reveal what you know under any circumstances. Follow the steps below to dispose of this heinous creature:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Order two small ham sandwiches from Subway</li>
		<li>Eat them</li>
		<li>Kiss the vampire</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The ham and pickle combination in the sandwich will put the vampire in a coma. You must follow these instructions precisely or it will not work and the vampire may become suspicious. Even if you are not attracted to the physical manifestation of evil, you must kiss the vampire reguardless. It is your duty to the rest of humanity</p>

	<h3 id="lesson_4">Lesson 4: Data on Vampire Victims</h3>

	<p>Like I have mentioned multiple times, vampires are proliffic throughout the human population. Throughout my research I have identified numerous suspicious deaths, the details of which I present in the table below. The table is organized by state and year in which the death occured. Keep in mind that this information is only collected from reported deaths, meaning there are probably hundreds more deaths than what you can see below.</p>

	<table border="1">

			<td colspan="10" align="center">Deaths by vampires sorted by time period and state</td>

	<p>From the information in this table, I suspect that vampires might form social groups - much like covens in popular media. The high concentration of deaths in low populated states like Missouri indicates something more nefarious than the "accidents" that most of these deaths are labeled as. Given the low number of vampires, it would also make sense for groups to form for protection. Perhaps they even form independent communities so to minimize contact with humans outside of a feeding context.</p>
